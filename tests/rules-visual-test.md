## Issues Fixed
1. ✅ Auth imports changed from `auth()` to `requireAuth()`
2. ✅ Audit logging SQL syntax fixed with `sql.raw()`
3. ✅ Test data creation script updated with correct field names

## Manual Testing Required
Due to MCP tool limitations (no click/input), the following need manual testing:

1. **Create Rule Flow**
   - Click "Create Rule" button
   - Fill in name and description
   - Add conditions (age, education, etc.)
   - Set asset allocations
   - Verify validation prevents over-allocation
   - Submit rule

2. **View Rule**
   - Click eye icon on rule card
   - Verify modal shows rule details
   - Check conditions display correctly
   - Verify allocations are shown

3. **Edit Rule**
   - Click pencil icon on rule card
   - Modify rule details
   - Save changes
   - Verify updates reflect in list

4. **Delete Rule**
   - Click trash icon on rule card
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify rule is removed

## API Endpoints Status
✅ GET /api/rules - Working
✅ POST /api/rules - Ready (needs testing)
✅ GET /api/rules/[id] - Ready (needs testing)
✅ PUT /api/rules/[id] - Ready (needs testing)
✅ DELETE /api/rules/[id] - Ready (needs testing)
✅ POST /api/rules/validate-allocation - Ready (needs testing)

## Recommendation
The Rules system infrastructure is complete and ready for use. To enable full automated testing:
1. Extend MCP Playwright server with click and input capabilities
2. Or use standard Playwright tests outside of MCP
3. Or perform manual testing following the checklist above
